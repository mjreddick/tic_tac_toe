* On each subsequent turn which of the 9 regular tic tac toe boards the player is allowed to move in is determined by the last players move as follows:
	* Whatever position on the regular tic tac toe board the player picks will determine the board the next player can play on.  For example, If the last player moved in the top right corner of the regular tic tac toe board the next player can only move in the top right regular tic tac toe board.
	* If the regular board that player would normally play on is full then the player can pick any open spot on any regular board
* Once a board is won by a player it cannot be won again, however it can still be played on until the board is full.
